# ML_Capstone_Learning
This repository contains my capstone project as part of my AI/ML learning course.
Idea is to focus on applying AI/ML concepts to build a practical/ reliable solution.

Module 5

This repository documents my Black-Box Optimisation (BBO) capstone project. The goal is to iteratively optimise eight unknown functions using machine learning. I apply Gaussian Process surrogate modelling with an adaptive exploration–exploitation strategy, refining query selections weekly based on accumulated feedback and uncertainty estimates. ├── data/ │ ├── raw/ # Initial datasets and weekly feedback │ ├── processed/ # Combined datasets per function │ ├── notebooks/ # Experimental modelling notebooks │ ├── src/ │ ├── surrogate_model.py # Gaussian Process implementation │ ├── acquisition.py # UCB / EI logic │ ├── utils.py # Helper functions │ ├── results/ │ ├── weekly_submissions/ # Query history │ ├── performance_logs/ # Best values per iteration │ ├── requirements.txt ├── README.md
